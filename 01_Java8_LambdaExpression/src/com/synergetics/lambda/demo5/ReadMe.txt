Please refer to the word document "Java 8 Features with Scenario", Topic: "Scenario 5: Using lambda for sorting of objects"
as the code here is in support of its concept

Lab1 shows a classical case study. A concrete class implements the Comparator interface 

Lab2 shows the second approach, Using an anonymous class implements the comparator interface

Lab3 shows: if we use the lambda expression it could be written in a very short way 

Please note the arraylist method sort accepts an Comparator reference. so we can use a lambda expression that could return a 
object of the Comparator Functional interface
