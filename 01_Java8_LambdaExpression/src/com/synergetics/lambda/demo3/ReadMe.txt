Please refer to the word document "Java 8 Features with Scenario", Topic: "Scenario 3: Efficiency through laziness "
as the code here is in support of its concept

Refer to the file "NotUsingStreams1.java" first, where it how we used to accomplish, pre-java 8, functionalities over collection

Refer to the file "NotUsingStreams2.java" next, which shows how  "NotUsingStreams1.java" can be written in a better way, where one 
operation pipes output to next operation which in turn pipes to next operation. This is achived manually. There are drawbacks to 
this approach discussed in the document "Java 8 Features with Scenario"

Refer to the file "StreamsDemo.java" next which shows the use of java 8 Streams
