Please refer to the word document "Java 8 Features with Scenario", Topic: "Scenario 2)	Passing Behaviour and Not Only Values"
as the code here is in support of its concept

Refer to the class "SummationNotUsingLambdaExpression" first, which tries to show that when we require to implement new 
functionalites have small changes over earlier exisiting functionalities we copy, paste and make changes, hence the three
methods.

Refer to the class "SummationUsingLambdaExpression.java" next which tries to show how using lambda expression you can have one method
to which we can pass the data and the operation (Using Predicate (One of inbuild functional interface) and lambda to define behaviour).
